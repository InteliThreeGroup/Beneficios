## Executive Summary

The corporate benefits market moves billions globally and is directly linked to talent attraction and retention strategies. However, it is hampered by structural inefficiencies such as:

* High transaction fees charged to merchants (3% to 14%)
* Delayed payment transfers, harming cash flow
* Lack of transparency for HR departments regarding benefit usage and performance
* Low flexibility and portability for employees
* An extremely concentrated market, with few players controlling the entire chain

This scenario directly affects three pillars of the ecosystem: employers, employees, and commercial establishments.

In this context, **BeneChain** emerges as a decentralized corporate benefits platform, built entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), which eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and promotes end-to-end transparency.

## Benefits Market

The global corporate benefits market is on an accelerated growth trajectory, driven by organizations' increasing need to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive business environment. In Brazil, the corporate benefits sector, which includes food, meal, culture, and home office allowances, projects a growth of 9.05% by 2026. This expansion reflects the transition of benefits from mere salary complements to strategic human capital management tools.

### Overview

The market encompasses a wide range of benefits, which can be classified as legally mandated, traditional, and flexible. In Brazil, meal vouchers are the main service provided by supplier companies, being a "flagship" of the sector, alongside food vouchers. Other popular benefits include culture vouchers, introduced in 2012 to stimulate access to cultural products and experiences, and home office allowances, increasingly relevant with the rise of remote work. In addition to these, health and dental plans, life insurance, mobility credits, and educational incentives are widely offered.

### How It Works

Traditionally, the operation is based on benefit operators acting as intermediaries. Human resources departments contract these operators to provide vouchers to their employees. The amounts are pre-loaded onto cards or digital platforms, which can be used by employees at an accredited network of establishments.

### Benefits for Key Players

Corporate benefits operate as a multifaceted value creation tool, generating distinct advantages for Human Resources departments, employees, and commercial establishments, and strengthening the business ecosystem as a whole.

* **Human Resources Departments:** Influence talent attraction and retention, increasing employee engagement by 20% and reducing turnover by 15% in companies that use comprehensive benefits platforms.
* **Employees:** Benefits improve quality of life, increase purchasing power, and promote autonomy in choosing the advantages that best meet their individual needs.
* **Commercial Establishments:** Gain increased revenue and greater customer loyalty by accepting these payment methods.

### Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Additionally, the corporate benefits market demonstrates a growing contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

* **SDG 1 – No Poverty**
    * **How it Contributes:** By increasing the purchasing power of workers, especially those with low incomes, benefits can help alleviate poverty and ensure access to basic necessities.
* **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being**
    * **How it Contributes:** Meal and food vouchers promote access to adequate nutrition. Health-related benefits (such as health plans or pharmacy assistance) and well-being (such as culture vouchers or gym assistance) also directly impact quality of life.
* **SDG 4 – Quality Education**
    * **How it Contributes:** While not directly, flexible benefits can be used to subsidize courses, books, or educational activities, promoting access to knowledge and professional development.
* **SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth**
    * **How it Contributes:** The benefits market fosters fairer labor relations, attracting and retaining talent, which contributes to productivity and sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, by boosting local consumption, it benefits the economy of establishments.
* **SDS 10 – Reduced Inequalities**
    * **How it Contributes:** By offering benefits that complement remuneration, companies can reduce wage inequalities and ensure more workers have access to essential resources, regardless of their hierarchical level.

## Problem

The market faces significant challenges that create pain points for everyone involved:

### For Human Resources:

* **Lack of Control Over Usage:** HR departments often find themselves in the dark when it comes to the effective use of benefits. Without clear information on how employees are using these resources, they often only have access to the amount spent and the establishment's name.
* **Difficulty in Personalization:** Benefit operator offerings are often rigid, with predefined packages that limit companies' ability to customize options. This means that companies may have difficulty assembling a package that truly reflects the organization's culture or the diverse needs of a heterogeneous workforce.

### For Employees:

* **Low Flexibility:** When changing jobs, it's common for employees to have to get used to a new benefit card or platform, which causes unnecessary inconvenience and bureaucracy.
* **Reduced Purchasing Power:** One of the biggest pain points for employees are "hidden" fees. These fees, not always clear, end up eroding the benefit's purchasing power, decreasing the real value that reaches the employee's pocket.

### For Commercial Establishments:

* **High Fees:** For merchants, especially small and medium-sized ones, the fees charged by operators (generally between 3% and 6% per transaction) represent a significant portion of their revenue. This high cost directly impacts the profit margin, making the acceptance of certain benefits less attractive or unfeasible for some businesses.
* **Delayed Transfer of Funds:** Waiting days or even weeks to receive funds from benefit transactions is a major challenge for establishments' cash flow.
* **Dependence on Monopolies:** The benefits market is often dominated by a few large operators, creating a dependency for establishments. This concentration of power can result in poor customer support and little room for negotiating fees or conditions.

## Business Model

### TAM SAM SOM

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
The TAM represents the total revenue that can be generated if 100% of the target market buys the product or service. In the context of the benefits market, the TAM would be the total value spent by all companies (regardless of size, sector, or location) on corporate benefits for their employees, in addition to transaction fees and related services.
The global corporate benefits market is gigantic and continues to expand. Global market estimates point to hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars annually, depending on the breadth of the "benefits" definition. For example, the global employee benefits market was valued at US$232 billion in 2023.

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
The SAM represents the portion of the TAM that can be reached with the company's current business model, considering its technology, delivery capacity, and geographical/sectoral focus.
In Brazil, this market was valued at approximately US$15 billion in 2023. The SAM would be a considerable slice of this value, including companies seeking to modernize their benefits models, going beyond traditional ones.

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
The SOM is the realistic portion of the SAM that a company can conquer within a certain period, considering its sales strategy, resources, competition, and brand recognition. For a new benefit operator or one offering innovative solutions, the SOM may start small, perhaps 1-5% (US$150 million) of the SAM in the first year, but with a good product and execution, it can grow significantly.
